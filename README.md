# devifylabs (minimal React scaffold)

This is a minimal React + Vite scaffold placed directly in the project root. Theme: black & white, minimal.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- Files created at project root: `package.json`, `index.html`, `src/`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`.
- I did not run `npm install` here. If you want, I can run install and start the dev server for you.
- Next steps: implement layout, add routing, or wire up design — tell me what you want and I'll implement it.
